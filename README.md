1.>>In this repo, basically i have worked on the todolist where i have implement the addition of the new task and deletion functionality of the to do task, 
as well as it has eye-pleasant ui and tells you the no tasks added to the list.

2.>>Talking about the second assignment is of hackerjobportal, it inloves fetching the data from the api and playing with the query parameter of api.
